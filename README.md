# CubeSat System Reference Model (CSRM)
Welcome to the CubeSat System Reference Model project. This will be used to maintain published versions of the CSRM.

The CSRM includes a glossary and uses the CSRM Profile to provide consistency and interoperability. The CSRM Profile is a product of a collaboration between INCOSE and the OMG that is managed as a standard by the OMG under the Space Domain Task Force.

The project will contain both vendor specific, standard XMI and other formats. The issue system will be used for planning and support issues of the CSRM (CSRM profile is manage seperately by the OMG). The discussion area will be used to discuss planning and aid in training for the CSRM.

There are no hosted files yet. We need to choose an open source licence and a little more work on the CSRM. However, here is the current CSRM published at OpenMBEE.org:

# CubeSat System Reference Model (CSRM)
Welcome to the CubeSat System Reference Model project. This will be used to maintain published versions of the CSRM.

The CSRM includes a glossary and uses the CSRM Profile to provide consistency and interoperability. The CSRM Profile is a product of a collaboration between INCOSE and the OMG that is managed as a standard by the OMG under the Space Domain Task Force.

The project will contain both vendor-specific, standard XMI and other formats. The issue system will be used for planning and supporting issues of the CSRM (the CSRM profile is managed separately by the OMG). The discussion area will be used to discuss planning and aid in training for the CSRM.

There are no hosted files yet. We need to choose an open-source license and do more work on the CSRM. However, here is the current CSRM published at OpenMBEE.org:
